# Similarity Detection

_This service was created as a result of the OpenReq project funded by the European Union Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme under grant agreement No 732463._

## Introduction

The component is based in tf-idf numerical statistic. The aim of the API is to calculate the similarity score between multiple pairs of requirements.

## Technical description

Next sections provide a general overview of the technical details of the similarity detection service.

### Main functionalities

There are four types of operations (each method has a more extensive description in its own operation box):

    - Model: These methods are responsible for pre-processing the input requirements, generating a model that saves the requirements information and assigning it to an organization. Generating these models is mandatory before making any comparison.
        - BuildModel: Pre-processes the input requirements, generates a model and assings it to an specified organization.
        - AddRequirements: Pre-processes the input requirements and adds them to an existing model. Also it updates the clusters if the model has them.
        - DeleteRequirements: Deletes the input requirements from an existing model. Also it updates the clusters if the model has them.
    - Compare: These methods are in charge of comparing and returning the corresponding similarity dependencies between the specified requirements of an organizationâ€™s model.
        - ReqReq: Compares two requirements.
        - ReqProject: Compares between a list of requirements and a set of requirements.
        - ReqOrganization: Pre-processes the input requirements and adds them to an organization's model. Also it compares the input requirements with all the requirements of the organization's model.
        - Project: Compares all possible pairs of requirements from a set of requirements.
        - AddReqsAndCompute: Generates a model with the input requirements and computes the similarity score between all the possible pairs of requirements.
    - Clusters: These methods are responsible for pre-processing the input requirements and dependencies, generating a model that saves the requirements information and the clusters architecture and assigning it to an organization.
        - AddClusters: Pre-processes the input requirements, generates a model with the requirements information and the clusters architecture and assings it to an specified organization.
        - AddClustersAndCompute: Pre-processes the input requirements, generates a model with the requirements information and the clusters architecture and assings it to an specified organization. Also it compares all the one-requirement cluster centroids with the rest of centroids.
        - ReqClusters: Pre-processes the input requirements and adds them to an organization's model. Also it compares the input requirements with all the cluster centroids of the organization's model.
    - Auxiliary methods:
        - GetResponse: Returns in patches the resulting dependencies of the other methods
        - DeleteOrganizationResponses: Deletes the organization responses from the database
        - DeleteDatabase: Deletes all data from the database

The API uses UTF-8 charset. Also, it uses the OpenReq format for input JSONs.


### Used technologies

The service is divided into two independent components: SimilarityDetectionAPI and ComparerAPI. The first one is the main component in charge of receiving the requests and returning the final results whereas Comparer computes the similarity dependencies between the input requirements. The TestingRestService is just a client example to test the service.

    - SimilarityDetectionAPI: main component
    - ComparerAPI: auxiliary component
    - TestingRestSercice: example of client
    - testing: directory with input and output examples used to test
    - data: directory with the database files
    - LICENSE: license

### Asynchronous service

All operations except ReqClusters, GetResponse, DeleteOrganizationResponses and DeleteDatabase are asynchronous. It is necessary to write a server URL as parameter in all of them. The outcome of the operation will be returned to that url. All these operations follow the same pattern:

    1.The client calls the operation with all necessary parameters
    2.The service receives the request and checks the main conditions
    3.The service returns if the client request has been accepted or not and closes the connection
        3.1.(httpStatus!=200) The request has not been accepted. The message body contains the exception cause.
        3.2.(httpStatus==200) The request has been accepted. The similarity calculation runs in the background. The message body contains the request identifier i.e. {"id": "1548924677975_523"}
    4. When the calculation finishes (only if the request has been accepted) the service opens a connection with the server url specified as parameter. It sends a Json object that contains the outcome of the computation:
        4.1.(success) Example: {"code": 200,"id": "1557395889689_587","operation": "AddReqs"}.
        4.2.(!success) Example: {"code": 400,"id": "1557396039530_583","error": "Bad request","message": "The requirement with id QM-3 is already inside the project","operation": "ReqProject"}.
        4.3.The resulting dependencies can be obtained via the GetResponse method.

    2. The service receives the request and checks the main conditions
    3. The service returns if the client request has been accepted or not and closes the connection
        3.1. (httpStatus!=200) The request has not been accepted. The message body contains the exception cause.
        3.2. (httpStatus==200) The request has been accepted. The similarity calculation runs in the background. The message body contains the request identifier i.e. {"id": "1548924677975_523"}
    4. When the calculation finishes (only if the request has been accepted) the service opens a connection with the server url specified as parameter (optional). It sends a Json object that contains the outcome of the computation:
        4.1. (success) Example: {"code": 200,"id": "1557395889689_587","operation": "AddReqs"}.
        4.2. (!success) Example: {"code": 400,"id": "1557396039530_583","error": "Bad request","message": "The requirement with id QM-3 is already inside the project","operation": "ReqProject"}.
    5. The result of the operation can be obtained through the GetResponse method.

### How to install

Steps to configure the service:

1. Download and install 8 JDK and last Maven version.

Steps to run the service:

    1.Open a terminal and copy-paste "sh run_similarity_detection.sh". Wait for an exit like this: u.s.s.SimilaritydetectionapiApplication : Started SimilaritydetectionapiApplication

    2.Open a terminal and copy-paste "sh run_comparer.sh". Wait for an exit like this: u.s.comparerapi.ComparerApplication : Started ComparerapiApplication

    3.(only if you wanna use the auxiliary client) Open a terminal and copy-paste "sh run_restservice.sh". Wait for an exit like this: u.s.restserviceapi.RestServiceApplication : Started RestServiceApplication

    4.Go to http://localhost:9404/swagger-ui.html#/ to see the swagger generated. You can use the component through the swagger or through http connections to the endpoints indicated in the swagger documentation.


### How to use it

The service expects a JSON with OpenReqJson format.
